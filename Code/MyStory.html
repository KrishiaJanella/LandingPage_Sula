                    My childhood, though a mix of joy, love, and sorrow, is a bit fuzzy in my memory,
        filled with moments that blur together.<sup>1</sup> Born from a teenage pregnancy, my mom was
        just 18, and my dad, 22, forming a young family with uncertain beginnings.<sup>2</sup> They met in
        college, but a tragic incident separated them four years later, leaving behind
        unanswered questions about their past.<sup>3</sup> I don't know much more about their history
        because my mom and I didn't talk about it much, perhaps shielding me from painful
        truths.<sup>4</sup> Maybe she just didn't want me to miss my dad, who was taken by a road
        accident, leaving a void in our lives.<sup>5</sup>
        During the four years when my dad was around, I felt incredibly special, basking
        in his love and attention.<sup>6</sup> We shared a strong bond, and I was a total daddy's girl,
        cherishing every moment together.<sup>7</sup> Even when he got mad at me for being naughty,
        those are the happy memories I hold onto dearly.<sup>8</sup>
        One particular memory stands out when I was 2 – always asking for a <strong>dollhouse</strong> ,
        a simple desire amidst financial struggles.<sup>9</sup> Money was tight; my dad worked in fast-food
        joints, and my mom just finished college, making ends meet with difficulty.<sup>10</sup> Despite that,
        my whims were never granted until one day when my dad got creative, showcasing his
        resourcefulness and love.<sup>11</sup> I remember finding him at a table outside our house, using
        cardboard from a nearby store to create a dollhouse replica of our home, a gesture that
        touched my heart deeply.<sup>12</sup> It might not have been as fancy as store-bought ones, but it
        was the most beautiful thing to me, a symbol of his love and dedication.<sup>13</sup>
        After my dad unexpectedly passed away before I turned 5, the only thing I
        remember him giving me is that dollhouse, a precious memento that holds immense
        sentimental value.<sup>14</sup> It's a constant reminder of his love and dedication, going the extra
        mile with limited resources, leaving a lasting imprint on my heart.<sup>15</sup> What makes the
        dollhouse special is that it's one of a kind, created by my father with the sole purpose of
        making me happy, a testament to his creativity and love.<sup>16</sup>
        The loss of my father shaped my childhood, and as I grew older, I realized I lost
        many memories trying to hold onto the moments we had together, a bittersweet journey
        of remembrance.<sup>17</sup> Being a daddy's girl and then losing him was painful, but it molded me
        into the strong woman I am today, and for that, I'm grateful, carrying his legacy within
        me. <sup>18</sup> Those memories, though sometimes painful, are the foundation of who I've
        become, guiding me through life's challenges with resilience and gratitude.<sup>19</sup> Amidst the
        haze of recollection, I find solace in the lessons learned and the love that continues to
        shape my journey.<sup>20</sup>

                    My high school years were a rollercoaster of events, filled with both laughter and
        tears.<sup>1</sup> It was during this period that I became acutely aware of our financial struggles,
        with my mother being the sole breadwinner in our family.<sup>2</sup> To alleviate the financial
        burden, I made the decision to enroll in a public school for high school.<sup>3</sup> Taytay National
        High School became my new academic home, and initially, the environment felt
        overwhelming – hot classrooms and overcrowded spaces, a stark contrast to my private
        elementary school.<sup>4</sup>
        Despite my initial doubts, as days passed, I realized the invaluable knowledge I
        gained from excellent teachers at little to no cost.<sup>5</sup> I was fortunate to be part of the pilot
        class, the Special Science Class (SSC), where high-achieving students were grouped
        together.<sup>6</sup> This class brought its challenges with stringent grade requirements,
        demanding expectations, and additional classes like research, pre-calculus, advanced
        physics, and statistics.<sup>7</sup> Juggling these commitments with school organizations, contests,
        and events proved challenging, but I navigated through successfully.<sup>8</sup>
        Being part of the SSC not only provided advanced knowledge crucial for my
        college journey but also played a significant role in shaping my character.<sup>9</sup> It cultivated
        resilience, studiousness, and a strong work ethic.<sup>10</sup> Besides my family's support, the
        class, dedicated teachers, former classmates, and the intense yet memorable
        environment were instrumental in my success in passing the DOST scholarship exam.<sup>11</sup>
        Witnessing the result was a moment of immense joy and pride.<sup>12</sup> Now, with the
        scholarship, I can contribute to my college expenses without burdening my mother with
        hefty tuition fees and associated costs.<sup>13</sup> My high school experience wasn't just about
        academic grind; it was a journey of self-improvement driven by the desire to support my
        family and secure a better future for myself.<sup>14</sup>
        Reflecting on those years fills me with gratitude for the friendships forged, the
        lessons learned, and the growth experienced.<sup>15</sup> Each challenge I faced became an
        opportunity to strengthen my resolve and determination, preparing me for the journey
        ahead.<sup>16</sup> As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I carry with me the lessons learned
        and the memories cherished from my high school years.<sup>17</sup>
        Those formative years not only shaped my academic trajectory but also instilled
        in me a sense of resilience and determination that continues to guide me today.<sup>18</sup> The
        bonds forged during my high school journey remain steadfast, serving as a reminder of
        the strength found in community and shared aspirations.<sup>19</sup> As I look back on those
        transformative years, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences that have molded me
        into the person I am today.<sup>20</sup>

                    Starting college was nerve-wracking for me.<sup>1</sup> Originally, I had planned to enroll in
                    a public university due to its affordability and my familiarity with the public school
                    environment.<sup>2</sup> However, my mother insisted that a private school, specifically UE known
                    for excellence in IT, would offer better opportunities and learning experiences.<sup>3</sup> With a
                    scholarship to cover tuition fees, I yielded to my mother's persuasion.<sup>4</sup>
                    Being naturally introverted, adapting to a new environment with unfamiliar faces
                    was overwhelming.<sup>5</sup> Despite my initial reservations, I worked diligently at the start of the
                    semester, particularly since I had little knowledge about my chosen course, though the
                    field of technology fascinated me.<sup>6</sup> Surprisingly, programming, a subject I feared before
                    college, turned out to be enjoyable, albeit challenging at times.<sup>7</sup> The semester also
                    introduced me to new friends, adding excitement to my college experience.<sup>8</sup>
                    Living far from the university posed its own set of challenges.<sup>9</sup> Commuting daily
                    from my residence required waking up at 3:30 in the morning for a 7:30 class, creating
                    stress before the school day even began.<sup>10</sup> Days with physical education classes added
                    to the struggle, with the need to carry an extra bag for my PE uniform and rubber shoes.<sup>11</sup>
                    Despite these hardships, my efforts paid off, qualifying me for the university scholarship,
                    which, thankfully, allowed me to secure a dormitory.<sup>12</sup>
                    The dormitory significantly improved my college life by saving time on commuting
                    and providing a conducive environment for studying and pursuing other interests.<sup>13</sup>
                    Achieving this scholarship and the positive changes it brought have brought me genuine
                    happiness.<sup>14</sup>
                    As I navigate through college, I aim to make the most of every opportunity that
                    comes my way, embracing challenges and growth with enthusiasm.<sup>15</sup> Each step forward
                    brings me closer to my goals, and I'm determined to seize every moment with passion
                    and dedication.<sup>16</sup> With a supportive network of friends and mentors by my side, I am
                    confident that I can overcome any obstacles that may arise and thrive in my academic
                    pursuits.<sup>17</sup> Here's to embracing the journey ahead and making the most of every
                    experience that comes my way.<sup>18</sup> I look forward to continuing these achievements
                    throughout my college journey, and I'm excited for the next chapter in my life.<sup>19</sup> Until then,
                    see you in my next adventure.<sup>20</sup>
